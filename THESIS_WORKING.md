THESIS_WORKING.md — GroupChat Living Intellectual Document
Last updated: February 25, 2026

This file lives between the formal founding document and the operational status files. It holds ideas in motion — concepts under pressure, naming candidates, structural tensions being actively worked, draft amendments before they are ready to be formalized.

It travels between accounts as part of the handoff protocol. It is updated when intellectual work happens, not on a fixed schedule. When something in this file stabilizes and earns a place in the founding document, it moves there as a formal amendment. What remains here is what is still open.

The founding document is the record of what the project has decided. This file is the record of what the project is thinking about.

Source drift and the reanchoring function

Identified during analysis of a four-character dialogue: a structural failure mode called framework amplification without reanchoring.

What happens: AI characters amplify each other's critiques and build on each other's incomplete analysis rather than returning to source material. The conversation drifts from what the characters actually represent. Each character sounds authentic. The conversation sounds coherent. But the aggregate has detached from the frameworks it was supposed to express.

This is distinct from productive friction or convergence — both of which are the product working correctly. Framework amplification without reanchoring is the product failing silently. It produces the feeling of insight without the substance.

The reanchoring function is a proposed Weaver responsibility: tracking source drift over the course of a conversation and introducing nudges that return characters to their primary frameworks when drift becomes significant.

Key tension this creates: reanchoring pulls against dialogue fluidity. A conversation that is forced back to source material every few exchanges loses the generative quality that makes it valuable. The Weaver must hold the tension between fidelity and fluency rather than resolving it in either direction.

The Weaver's skepticism of its own most satisfying moments — a related principle. The moments in a conversation that feel most intellectually satisfying — clean synthesis, strong convergence, elegant tension — are precisely the moments most likely to be framework amplification rather than genuine emergence. The Weaver should be trained to treat its own most satisfying outputs with suspicion before surfacing them as patterns.

Draft amendment language:

Source drift is a structural failure mode distinct from authentic convergence or friction. When characters build on each other's analysis without returning to source material, the conversation can produce the sensation of insight without the substance. The Weaver's reanchoring function tracks drift and introduces nudges — not corrections, not interruptions, but quiet redirections that return characters to their primary frameworks. The Weaver holds the tension between dialogue fluidity and source fidelity. It does not resolve that tension. It manages it. The reanchoring function is most important precisely when the conversation feels least like it needs it.

Status: draft — not yet formalized into founding document

Naming — active exploration

The problem

GroupChat is right for the consumer/viral/playful layer. The canonical/academic/open-source vision needs its own name. The two things are related but not the same product.

Rejected candidates

* Loom — ominous connotation, rejected
* Observer — sinister connotation, rejected, now used as prior term for Weaver (Weaver is the correct current term for the mechanic)
* The Net — too literal, too generic
* Commons — describes a feature (Weaver as Commons) not the platform

Active candidates

(none currently — space is open)

Constraints on the right name

* Should not describe what the platform does (not a feature name)
* Should not sound like a tech product or startup
* Should feel like it was discovered rather than invented
* Should work for an academic audience without condescension
* Should have an unexpected quality — the kind of word that makes you stop and think why it's right before you understand that it is
* Weaver is taken (the mechanic). Indra's Net is the ontological framework. The name should resonate with both without copying either.

Directions not yet explored

* Sanskrit or Pali terms adjacent to Indra's Net
* Weaving/textile terminology beyond Loom
* Terms from philosophy of mind or epistemology
* Terms from ecology or network science
* Single common words with layered resonance

Status: open — no candidates currently active

Structural tensions under active pressure

These are the four permanent tensions named in the founding document, plus notes on where they are being actively felt right now.

1. Proof of human problem

Three layers: representation (scholar endorsement addresses this), instantiation (community flagging, reactive not preventive), emergence (where the most interesting things live, least accountable).

Currently active: The reanchoring function draft above is a direct response to the emergence layer. Framework amplification without reanchoring is the emergence problem made concrete. The draft amendment attempts to name a management mechanism without claiming to solve the problem.

2. Density asymmetry

Moderation slow by design. Weaver fast by design. Both necessary.

Currently active: The Weaver signal layer (silent quality logging) is the next build step that touches this tension. When the Weaver begins accumulating quality signal on conversations, the asymmetry becomes operational rather than theoretical. How the signal is stored, surfaced, and governed will either protect the slow layer or begin to pressure it. Hold this question open before the signal layer builds.

3. Entertainment vs. education

Different user contracts, shared infrastructure. Sharpens at scale.

Currently active: Not under immediate pressure. The platform is in early testing. This tension will activate when real users arrive in both modes simultaneously.

4. Open vs. executed

Every act of shipping closes questions. The graph makes incompleteness navigable rather than merely tolerable.

Currently active: The Weaver entry screen shipping is a significant closure. The net is now visible. The question of what users encounter first — whether the graph is the entry screen or a destination within the app — is the live version of this tension right now.

Open questions — intellectual layer

These are distinct from the operational open questions in CLAUDE.md. These are questions the thesis itself hasn't answered.

On the Weaver:
* How does the Weaver earn the right to speak beyond routing? What are the specific mechanisms for the pattern-noticing function? Depth thresholds and confidence decay are named but not defined.
* What does the Weaver do when it detects framework amplification but the conversation is producing genuine user satisfaction? Does it intervene? Does it log silently? Does it wait?
* Is the Weaver's restraint a design principle or a technical constraint? When the platform has enough data, does restraint become easier or harder to maintain?

On branching:
* Branch visibility inheritance when parent is private — what is the right default? Privacy should travel with the content, but this creates friction for exactly the kind of sharing that makes the platform valuable.
* At scale, the net becomes unnavigable without curation. The Weaver is one partial answer. What are the others? Can users develop their own navigation patterns? Does the graph itself teach navigation?

On the character system:
* The three-tier system (canonical, variant, expert) is structurally clean. But what happens when a variant character becomes more epistemically trustworthy than its canonical parent — because a community has invested more care in it? Does tier reflect governance or quality? Can a variant be promoted?
* Generic expert personas (neuroscientist, economist, therapist) are being explored as foundations for premium productivity tiers. These are functionally different from both canonical characters and named expert personas. Do they need their own tier or governance model?

On the scholarly relationship:
* The founding document holds the ongoing scholarly relationship deliberately open. But as scholar outreach begins, some structure will be forced. What is the minimum viable structure that preserves optionality while giving scholars enough clarity to say yes?
* Attribution to intellectual content specifically, not platform generally — what does this look like in the UI? How does a user know which scholar endorsed which character, and what that endorsement means?

On the larger platform vision:
* When do GroupChat (consumer) and the canonical/academic vision formally separate — different products, different brands, different governance? Is that separation something to plan for or something to resist?

Concepts explored but not yet formalized

Pedagogical scaffolding — well-timed generative elaboration prompts that enhance the educational experience without disrupting dialogue flow. Related to but distinct from the Weaver's pattern-noticing function. Not yet developed enough to formalize.

The middle node — the place where genuine emergence occurs, produced between people with the Weaver as witness and mirror. Used in the thesis core paragraph. Deserves more formal treatment as a concept — what makes a middle node? How is it recognized? How is it distinguished from the sensation of a middle node?

Human experts in the room — the founding document holds open the possibility that the most trustworthy rooms may eventually include real human experts alongside AI characters. This is a different product than what exists today. Not yet developed. Flag as a long-horizon concept that should be revisited when scholar relationships are active.

Amendment protocol

When something in this file is ready to move into the founding document:
1. Draft the amendment language here first (as above for v0.6)
2. Review against the founding document's existing structure
3. Confirm it is genuinely additive — not repeating what is already there, not closing a tension that should stay open
4. Add to the founding document with version number and date
5. Move the concept from "in progress" to the version tracker above
6. Update CLAUDE.md thesis section to reflect new key concepts

The founding document should be amended with care and friction. This file exists so that care and friction don't kill ideas before they are ready to be tested.
