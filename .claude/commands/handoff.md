Immediately update CLAUDE.md with current project status. Update HANDOFF.md with what was just completed, what is in progress, what comes next, and what the next priorities are. Update THESIS_WORKING.md if any intellectual work happened — new concepts, naming candidates, structural tensions under pressure, or draft amendment language. Cross-reference and update all status files. Confirm when done.
